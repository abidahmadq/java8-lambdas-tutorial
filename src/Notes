Why Lambdas?
1) Enables functional Programming
2) Readable and concise code.
3) Easier to use API's and libraries.
4) Enables support for parallel processing

Functional Programming vs OOP
1) Some places functional programming looks more elegant.

Code in OOP:-
1) Everything is an object.
2) All code blocks are associated with classes and objects.
3) Can't pass a behavior always have to create an class with behaviour.

Lambda:-
1) Are not methods of class and they don't exist inside class.
2) They are functions with values.

Examples :- 
1) greetingFunction = () -> System.out.println("Hello World!");
2) doubleNumberFunction = (int a) -> { return a * 2; }; can also skip the return.
   doubleNumberFunction = (int a) ->  a * 2;
3) addFunction = (int a, int b) -> a + b;
4) safeDivide =  (int a, int b) -> {
		if(b == 0) return 0;
		return a / b;
	};
5) stringLengthCountFunction = (String s) -> s.length();
